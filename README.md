### What is this repo all about?

The repo was created to submit my Shell Scripts and PowerShell Scripts during my Code Fellows Cyber Ops Bootcamp from JUN22-DEC22.

### Why am I learning these skills?

I am learning these skills to make me a better Cybersecurity expert/engineer. All-in-all, this repo is full of challenges that are preparing me for a future in the Cybersecurity workforce.

### What fundamental concepts did I learn in Ops 201?

I learned to deploy and troubleshoot Windows and Linux operating systems in various virtual and cloud environments.
    - Customer Service
    - Knowledge and process documentation
    - System shell proficiency
    - Performance monitoring
    - System process management
    - Issue handling
    - Backup/Imaging/recovery tools
    - Software application installation/maintenance/removal

### What was my favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?

My favorite Ops Challenge of Ops 201 was the arrays.sh. It was my favorite because it does a lot and there isn't a lot of code. The simplicity of the code vs what it does it great.

### How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?

Some of these shell scripting examples can be used to track system information or status reports. They can also go through directories and create them in one press of the enter key. Functionality of these scripts are endless.

### What scripts would I continue to improve if I had the time?

My Class 05 (loopkill.sh) is one I want to work more on, as well as, the domains.sh. 

### What aspects of my shell scripting skillset do I hope to improve next?

I am not the best or most convenient coder, but I have enjoyed watching my codes at least run these past few weeks. I am looking to learn more complex concepts and help me understand the simple concepts that much more.
